# ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. The project demonstrates how to preprocess time series data, identify optimal parameters for ARIMA, and forecast future values.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, resample data, and ensure stationarity.
- **Model Selection**: Use ACF and PACF plots to identify the best ARIMA parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measure forecast accuracy using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
- **Visualization**: Plot actual vs predicted values and forecast future trends.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Well-documented code and markdown cells for easy understanding.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `scipy`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scipy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arima-time-series.git
   cd arima-time-series
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook arima-model-for-time-series-forecasting.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load your dataset, preprocess data, and build the ARIMA model.

## Project Structure

- `arima-model-for-time-series-forecasting.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the implementation.
- `data/`: Folder to store your time series dataset (add your dataset here).
- `results/`: Output graphs and model evaluation metrics (auto-generated).

## Example Output

## Customization

- Replace the sample dataset with your own time series data.
- Adjust ARIMA parameters to optimize for your dataset.
- Extend the model to include seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) if seasonality is present.
